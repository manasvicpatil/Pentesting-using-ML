This module compiles a Linux shared object file, uploads it to the target host via the UPDATE pg_largeobject method of binary injection, and creates a UDF (user defined function) from that shared object. Because the payload is run as the shared object's constructor, it does not need to conform to specific Postgres API versions.",shell,exploit/linux/postgres/postgres_payload,0,payload/linux/x86/shell/bind_ipv6_tcp_uuid,[URL]@http://www.leidecker.info/pgshell/Having_Fun_With_PostgreSQL.txt@@
